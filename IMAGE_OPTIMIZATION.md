# Image Optimization Setup

This project now includes automatic image optimization for UploadThing uploads, reducing storage costs and improving performance.

## Features

✅ **Automatic client-side image optimization** before upload  
✅ **Sharp-based server-side optimization** for existing images  
✅ **Seamless integration** with existing admin interface  
✅ **Migration script** for existing local images  

## How It Works

### New Uploads (Client-Side Optimization)

When uploading images through the admin dashboard:

1. **Image Selection**: User selects images via the upload dropzone
2. **Browser Optimization**: Images are automatically optimized using Canvas API:
   - Resized to max 1200x1200px while maintaining aspect ratio
   - Compressed to 85% JPEG quality
   - Converted to JPEG format for consistency
3. **Upload to UploadThing**: Optimized images are uploaded to UploadThing
4. **Database Update**: Product images field is updated with UploadThing URLs

### Components

- **`OptimizedUploadDropzone`**: Enhanced UploadDropzone with built-in optimization
- **`ImageUpload`**: Admin component using the optimized uploader
- **Browser optimization utilities**: Canvas-based image processing

## Migration Script

### Purpose
Optimize and migrate existing local images (`/uploads/products/...`) to UploadThing.

### Usage

```bash
# Run the migration script
node scripts/migrate-and-optimize-images.js
```

### What the script does:

1. **Finds products** with local image paths starting with `/uploads/`
2. **Optimizes images** using Sharp:
   - Resizes to max 1200x1200px
   - Compresses to 85% JPEG quality
   - Reports compression ratio
3. **Uploads to UploadThing** using UTApi
4. **Updates database** with new UploadThing URLs
5. **Provides detailed progress** and summary report

### Script Output Example:

```
🚀 Starting image optimization and migration to UploadThing...

📦 Found 15 products to check

🔍 Processing: Deri Çanta Model 1 (cm1a2b3c)
  📁 Found 3 local images to migrate
  🔄 Processing: /uploads/products/c1/image1.jpg
  📸 image1.jpg: 2.1MB → 450KB bytes (78.6% reduction)
  ✅ Uploaded: https://uploadthing.com/f/abc123...
  ...
  💾 Updated database with 3 image URLs
  ✅ Product successfully migrated

📊 Migration Summary:
  ✅ Successfully processed: 12 products
  ⏭️  Skipped (already migrated): 3 products
  ❌ Errors encountered: 0 images

🎉 Migration completed!
```

## Configuration

### Image Optimization Settings

**Client-Side (Browser)**:
- Max width: 1200px
- Max height: 1200px
- Quality: 85%
- Format: JPEG

**Server-Side (Sharp)**:
- Max width: 1200px
- Max height: 1200px
- Quality: 85%
- Format: JPEG
- Progressive: true
- mozjpeg: true

### Customization

You can adjust optimization settings in:

- **Browser optimization**: `src/utils/browserImageOptimization.ts`
- **Server optimization**: `src/utils/imageOptimization.ts`
- **Migration script**: `scripts/migrate-and-optimize-images.js`

## File Structure

│   ├── browserImageOptimization.ts   # Client-side Canvas optimization

```

## Benefits

### Storage Savings
- **70-80% file size reduction** on average
- Reduced UploadThing storage costs
- Faster uploads and downloads

### Performance
- **Faster page loads** due to smaller images
- **Improved user experience** on mobile devices
- **Optimized bandwidth usage**

### Automatic Processing
- **No manual intervention** required for new uploads
- **Consistent optimization** across all images
- **Maintains image quality** while reducing size

## Troubleshooting

### Migration Script Issues

**Error: "File not found"**
- Ensure images exist in `public/uploads/products/` directory
- Check file permissions

**Error: "Upload failed"**
- Verify UploadThing API key is set in environment variables
- Check network connectivity
- Ensure UploadThing account has sufficient quota

**TypeScript errors in script**
- The script is written in JavaScript and may show TS linting warnings
- These can be safely ignored as the script runs correctly

### Client-Side Upload Issues

**Canvas API not supported**
- Falls back to original files if Canvas optimization fails
- Modern browsers should support all required APIs

**Large file handling**
- Files larger than browser memory limits may fail
- Consider server-side processing for very large files

## Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in your `.env` file:

```env
UPLOADTHING_TOKEN=your_uploadthing_token_here
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url_here
```

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] **WebP format support** for better compression
- [ ] **Progressive loading** with blur placeholders
- [ ] **Automatic format detection** and optimization
- [ ] **Batch processing** improvements
- [ ] **Image metadata preservation** options
